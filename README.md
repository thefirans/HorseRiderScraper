# HorseRiderScraper

This order from freelance posting with the customer's permission

This Python script uses `Selenium` for web automation, `re` for text pattern matching, and `gspread` to interact with Google Sheets. It scrapes data from a webpage, such as rider and horse information, and uploads it to a Google Sheets document.
